Location-driven web solution for promoting tourism in Romania

Problem:
The no. of classes is very high, so a simplified interface would help manage the options.
Define a high-level interface that makes the subsystems easier to use.
Make the calls to the other classes be masked by only one common interface

Advantages:
the framework is not rewritten
an intermediar layer is added to hide the complexity of the framework behind

Disadvantages:
there are many wrapper classes
the code is very complex and can affect performance
