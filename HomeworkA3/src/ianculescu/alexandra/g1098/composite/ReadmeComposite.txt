Location-driven web solution for promoting tourism in Romania

Problem:
We want to centralize the tourism packages into a tourism catalog and display
the history of destinations, nights, tickets and meal plans. Group in hierarchycal relations
and treat the objects uniformly.

Advantages:
the framework is not beign rewritten
the code gets easier because the objects in the hierarchy are treated uniformly

Disadvantages:
implementation of component interfaces is very challenging
subsequent adjustment of composite features is difficult and cumbersome to realize
