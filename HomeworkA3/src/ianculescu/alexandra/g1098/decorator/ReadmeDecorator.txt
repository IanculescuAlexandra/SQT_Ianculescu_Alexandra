Location-driven web solution for promoting tourism in Romania

Problem:
Tourism package is extended so clients can choose to add transportation in the package


Advantages:
there are no limits for the maximum number of decorations
the decoration is done on many levels, transparent for the client

Disadvantages:
the object is a wrapper of the initial object and it is not identical
too much use of this pattern generate objects that look the same but behave differently
which makes the code harder to be read
